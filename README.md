# ENDAVA CHALLENGES
## 4. Back End - Spring Boot
#### *Week 6* 

As an Endava customer, we want to have an application like twitter to be able to use it internally in our company.
To start this project, we want to have basic functionalities, and depending on the needs, we will add more requirements in the future. As a first step, we want an API that exposes some endpoints so in the future the front-end team can use them.

- Have some tweets saved on the database as an initial setup.
- Ceate an account.
- Login/Logout. 
- Add/Modify/Delete tweets.
- Add/Remove like.
- See timeline and be able to sort and set filter.
